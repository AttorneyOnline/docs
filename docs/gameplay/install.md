## Installation

Here, we'll explain how to install Attorney Online. Installation is only required for the desktop version of AO, unlike webAO which can be run directly from the web browser.

### What's the Difference?

- **Platform support.** webAO works on anything with a web browser, including Android, iOS, Chrome OS, smart TVs, and probably cars. Desktop AO works natively on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Server support.** Desktop AO can access any server, whereas webAO can only access servers that support it.
- **Animation timing.** Desktop AO has perfect frame timing; webAO has various timing issues in its animations that disturb the experience.
- **Asset downloading.** Desktop AO allows you to install your own assets locally; webAO downloads a curated list automatically.
- **Large display support.** Desktop AO requires a custom theme to look good on a large screen; webAO resizes to fit the window out-of-the-box.
- **Development.** Both versions of AO are worked on by different teams.

In summary, while webAO is more convenient, the desktop version of AO is more robust and provides a more stable and authentic experience.

### Downloading

Install the client from the [website](https://aceattorneyonline.com/). The launcher is recommended, which does the extracting step for you and will automatically install updates whenever they are available.

### Extracting

Once you've downloaded the game, copy the contents of the ZIP file to any folder.

### Running

Double-click the Attorney Online executable file. For new releases, you may get a SmartScreen or antivirus warning; our software is not very popular, so sometimes it can take a while for virus scanners to recognize it as safe. You can safely ignore the warning.
