# Introduction

The AO Standard defines a client-server protocol, and the communication is done through packets.
These packets can either be sent over a TCP or Websocket connection.
This documentation provides information how these are structured and used.

All packets sent need to adhere to the specifications in
in Network Protocol and be serialized as specified in Serialization.
