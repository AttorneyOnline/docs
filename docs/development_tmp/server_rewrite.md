# So you want to write a new server?

Here are some considerations when planning it out:

- an optional GUI

A lot of server hosts are not the most technical people and would like to administrate their server without having to dive into text files and configuration switches.
Having a non-GUI version that can run on the config files generated by the GUI version would be optimal so you can run it on a headless machine.

- cross-platform

it should support linux and windows

- areas/hubs

People want to divide their server up to have more than 1 place to chat and maybe even multiple channel/area lists with hidden or inaccessible areas.

- websocket support

and along with that maybe even a web server to host the content for hosts who don't want to/are not able to install apache

- evidence/inventory

assign the client an inventory of items
in vanilla AO2 this is managed via the evidence
