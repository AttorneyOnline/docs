## Creating Characters

You're here because you want to make a character! There are three simple steps to creating a character:

1. Collect content (images and animations). The minimum recommended size is 256x192, but bigger content is fine too.
2. Create a `char.ini` file that describes them.
3. Package and distribute.

### 1. Collecting Content

First, you need to find or create content that you wish to make emotes out of.

#### Sizing

The minimum recommended size of your content is 256x192. Keep in mind that if your content's aspect ratio is different from the **viewport** (the area where characters appear; its size is controlled by your theme), your content will be resized to fit the viewport.

> **TODO:** Example screenshots would be nice, this section is pretty word-y - in1tiate

That being said, here are some basic rules when the viewport is not the same size as your content:

- If the viewport's size is an exact multiple of that of the content, it will be scaled using **nearest neighbor** filtering. This makes sure that sprite art doesn't get blurry.
- Content that is not exactly the same size as the viewport will be scaled according to its height.
- Content with an aspect ratio wider than the viewport will be centered and cropped at the left and right edges.
- Content with an aspect ratio narrower than the viewport will simply be centered within it.

We recommend that you make your content on a 4:3 canvas for the best all-around compatibility.

#### Animations

Emotes may be static or animated. For animated emotes, you'll want to make two animations: an _idle_ animation and a _talking_ animation. Some emotes may also have a _preanimation_.

You will need to name your emotes in a specific convention to be detected by the engine. For an animated emote called `foo`, the idle animation must be named `(a)foo.gif` and the talking animation `(b)foo.gif`. For a static emote, `foo.png` is enough. The preanimation can be any name (since they are often recycled).

You will encounter certain technical limitations of GIF rather quickly. There are two animation formats other than GIF which are fully supported:

- The animated PNG (APNG) format allows 8-bit transparency, palettes greater than 256 colors, and smaller file sizes. The [APNG Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/apngasm/) is recommended for this. *APNG is recommended for 2D characters.*
- Google's WebP is a format that provides not only the benefits of APNG, but also allows video-like animations to also enjoy small file sizes. The [official WebP utilities](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) are recommended. *Lossy WebP is recommended for 3D characters with high frame rates.*

#### Buttons

Once you have created your emotes, you will need to make button icons for them in an `emotions` folder inside the character folder. For each emote, there must be an "on" and "off" button named `buttonX_[off/on].png`, where X is the emote number which you will specify in the `char.ini` below. Icons should be 40x40.

The character icon is always named `char_icon.png` and is 60x60 in size.

#### Interjections (shouts)

You may also wish to customize the **interjections**, each of which have a fixed name:

- "Hold it!" (`holdit.wav`)
- "Take that!" (`takethat.wav`)
- "Objection!" (`objection.wav`)
- Custom (`custom.wav`)

You can have more than 1 custom interjection, which the player can use by right-clicking the "Custom" button. To do this, you need to place the interjection audio and animation in `custom_objections`. The folder structure will look like this:

```
characters/
    MyCharacter1/
	    custom.gif
	    custom.wav
	custom_objections/
        awesomecustomobj.gif
        awesomecustomobj.wav
        sadcustom.apng
        sadcustom.ogg
```

Since WAV files are very large, the Ogg Vorbis (`.ogg`) or Ogg Opus (`.opus`) format may also be used for any sound effect or interjection. *Opus is recommended.*

### 2. Creating a `char.ini`

#### Sample INI file

```ini
[Options]
name = Phoenix
showname = Wright
needs_showname = true
side = def
gender = male
chat = aa
chat_font = Igiari
chat_size = 10
shouts = aa
effects = default/effects
realization = realization

[Emotions]
number = 13
1 = pointing#-#pointing#0#
2 = thinking#-#thinking#0#
3 = normal#-#normal#0#
4 = confident#-#confident#0#
5 = paper#-#document#0#
6 = headshake#nope#-#1#
7 = slam#deskslam#handsondesk#1#
8 = nod#nodding#normal#1#
9 = damage#ohshit#sweating#1#
10 = zoom#-#zoom#5#
11 = bashful#-#sheepish#1#
12 = coffee#phoenix-chugs#phoenix-coffee#1#
13 = despair#sweating#phoenix-emo#1#

[SoundN]
7 = sfx-deskslam
9 = sfx-stab2
13 = sfx-deskslam
14 = sfx-deskslam

[SoundT]
7 = 4
```

#### `[Options]`

- `name`: specifies which folder to look for character assets, i.e. this should be named the same as the character folder. (Mischievious players can change this name to something else to use another character; this is called _ini-swapping._)

- `showname` (optional): this name will appear on the nameplate whenever the character speaks, however it is fetched locally which means if you write `showname = FINIX RAIT`, only you will see it. If you want to change your nameplate for everyone, type it in the "Showname" field while playing.

- `needs_showname` (optional, defaults to true): if false, use a blank showname.

- `side` (defaults to "wit"): modifies where in the courtroom the character initially appears. This is commonly called your **pos**, or **position**. Valid options:
  	- `def` - Defense
    - `pro` - Prosecution
    - `hld` - Helper defense
    - `hlp` - Helper prosecution
    - `jud` - Judge
    - `wit` - Witness
    - `jur` - Juror (since 2.6)
    - `sea` - Seance (since 2.6)

- `gender`: (optional, defaults to "male") modifies the sound that plays while your message text scrolls (colloquially called a **"blip"**).
  Blip sound effects can be located in `sounds/blips/` (recommended) or `sounds/general/` with the prefix `sfx-[blip]` (not recommended).

- `chat`: (optional, defaults to your theme's chatbox) allows characters to use custom **chatboxes** (the box your message appears in). Input should be a directory in `misc/` containing the chatbox you want to use.
  - For example, a character with `chat = dgs` will attempt to use the chatbox contained in `misc/dgs/`.
  - Assuming `chat_font` and `chat_size` are not set, this will also use the custom chatbox's font settings if it has them.
  > **TODO:** `misc/` folders have become somewhat more like miniature themes as of 2.8.4, and should have either a section in this guide or their own page. - in1tiate

- `chat_font`: (optional, defaults to either the one specified by `chat` or the one in your theme, in that order) modifies the font your message text will be in. This is clientside, so don't get any ideas about screwing with people by setting it to Comic Sans - you'll only be screwing with yourself!

- `chat_size`: (optional, same defaults as `chat_font`) modifies the size of your message text. Like `chat_font`, this is also clientside.

- `shouts`: (optional, defaults to your theme and is overridden by your character files) modifies the interjections, zooms, and realization flash your character will use if they aren't included in your character folder. These are located in `misc/`, just like `chat` - in fact, they often share a folder.

- `effects` (optional, defaults to `default/effects`): specifies misc folder to search for overlay effects, like `chat` and `shouts`.

- `realization` (optional): specifies custom realization sound to be played; must be located in `base/sound/general`.

#### `[Time]` (optional)

Made mostly redundant with release 2.8.4. The purpose of this section was to dictate the duration of pre-animations. This was a carry-over from AO1, which required it because of limitations in its engine (read: the inability of the author to read the duration from the file itself). Up until 2.8.4, preanimations would have to be "declared" in this section before they could be used in order to maintain backwards compatibility with AO1. `[Time]` can still be used to dictate preanim duration, but it is no longer strictly necessary.


#### `[Emotions]`

Onward to the `[Emotions]` section. This is where you configure what emotes your character has and how they work. The bulk of text in your ini will likely be here.

The `number` option is pretty self-explanatory. It specifies the number of emotes. Make sure this is correct - if it's too low, you won't be able to use all your emotes. If it's too high (or if you don't specify a `number`), you'll end up with placeholder emotes that'll clutter up your pages.

Now for the specific emotions.

##### `<comment>`

Emote **comments** will display in the dropdown menu and on the emote button itself if an emote icon for it could not be found. You can think of this as the "name" of the emote. You should make this pretty short - if it's too long, it'll probably get shortened by your theme.

##### `<preanim>`

The next section defines the **preanimation**, or the animation played before the character actually starts speaking. If there is none, a placeholder called `-` is typically used. Preanimations can be either in the root of the character folder or stored in a subfolder (generally named `anim`). To use a preanimation file from a subfolder, you must prefix the file name with the name of the folder. For example, a preanimation of `anim/deskslam` would correspond to this structure:

```
char.ini
anim/
	deskslam.gif
```

This works with multiple subfolders as well - for example, `anim/young/damage`:

```
char.ini
anim/
	young/
		damage.gif
```

Consider using subfolders if your character has a lot of files.

##### `<emote>` (idle and speaking animations)

Between the next #'s is the name of the actual animation when the character is idle and speaking, starting with `(a)` and `(b)` in the character folder, respectively. For instance, if your animation is named "cough", then the engine expects your idle animation to be named `(a)cough.gif` on the file system, and your talking animation to be named `(b)cough.gif`.

If something like `(c)cough.gif` is provided, that (c) animation will play during the transition from speaking to idle.

The engine will also scan for other supported file formats, such as `.apng` and `.webp`, as described above.

If no animations are found for an emote, the engine will fall back to static emotes. Static emotes don't use `(a)`/`(b)` prefixes - instead, an static emote named `cough` would be expected to be in the file `cough.png`.

If you're the type who likes to organize, you can also place files in subfolders, though the method is somewhat different from that of preanimations. To use subfolders, you must prefix your emotes with a forward slash (`/`). For `(a)`/`(b)` type emotes in subfolder mode, create two folders named `(a)` and `(b)` and place your prefix-less files in the appropriate folders. For example, the emote `/angry` will search for a file named `angry.gif` in `(a)/` and `(b)/` for idle and talking respectively. The same works for (c) animations.

As another example, the emote `/def/thinking` will search for a set of files arranged like this:

```
char.ini
(a)/
	def/
		thinking.gif
(b)/
	def/
		thinking.gif
```

This is a popular way to declutter the root of your character folder.

##### `<modifier>`

The modifier value controls pre-animations, sounds, and zooms. The valid inputs here are: 0, 1, 5, and 6.

- `0`: Tells the client to not play the pre-animation or sound effect associated with the emote, Has no effect on `[FrameSFX]` (more on that later)
- `1`: Plays the pre-animation and associated sound.
- `5`: Zoom, in which the foreground desk or witness stand will not be displayed. Additionally, the background is replaced by speed lines. Emotes with `5` will never play pre-animations.
- `6`: Same as 5, except it will _always_ play pre-animations.

##### `<deskmod>` (optional)

This option allows an emote to either force the desk/witness stand/overlay to be displayed, or force it to disappear. This takes precedence over all other factors affecting desk visibility.

- `-1`: Forcibly show the desks while this emote is displayed, except for `jud`/`hld`/`hlp` positions.
- `0`: Forcibly hide the desks while this emote is displayed.
- `1`: Forcibly show the desks while this emote is displayed.

#### `[SoundN]`

Under `[SoundN]`, we see a list of numbers equaling something else. The leftmost number is the emotion number and the value to the right is the sound effect associated with that emotion. In many cases, there isn't one, and therefore the line can be completely omitted. You'll notice in the sample char.ini below, only four emotes are included under `[SoundN]`. Many ini-editors will include emotes with no sounds as `= 1` - this is a holdover from AO1 and is not necessary.

Sounds specified will be searched for under `sounds/general/`. Subfolders can be used in much the same way as preanimations - see the relevant section above.

Note that the sound effect will only play when the "Pre" tick is checked, even if the emote has no valid preanimation.

#### `[SoundT]`

`[SoundT]` is essentially the delay before the sound effect is played. The input it takes is in **ticks**, which are 60 milliseconds each. The minimum value is `0`, which also happens to be the default. If there is no sound, or if the sound should be played instantly, it's safe to omit the line entirely.

The only value here is `7 = 4`, which is the `deskslam` emote. As you probably know, the `deskslam` sound is only supposed to play when hands actually come in contact with the desk and not in the start of the animation; the '4' value makes sure of that. Again, each tick is 60 milliseconds, so a value of `4` causes a wait of 240 milliseconds before the sound is played.

#### `[SoundL]`

This section defines which emotes (by emote number) should loop sound effects, or which sound effects in general (by name) should loop.

For each entry, the sound effect will loop if the value is `1`.

```
[SoundL]
1 = 0
2 = 1
sound = 1
```

### `[<emote>_FrameSFX]`

This section lists the sound effects that should play at certain frame numbers, for a specified emote.

```ini
# Replace pre-minigun with the reference to the animation for which to set this frame sfx to
[pre-minigun_FrameSFX]
# Frame number for which the specified sound should play.
10 = soj-sarge-hatch
18 = soj-sarge-extend
40 = soj-sarge-cock
50 = soj-sarge-shoot
180 = soj-sarge-retract
204 = soj-armie-drone-set
212 = soj-sarge-hatch
```

### `[<emote>_FrameRealization]`

This section defines at which frame a screen flash should occur. (The realization sound effect is not played.)

```ini
# Replace pre-salute with the reference to the animation for which to set this screen flash to
[pre-salute_FrameRealization]
# Frame 32 screen flash = true. Does not play realization sound effect.
32 = 1
```

### `[<emote>_FrameScreenshake]`

This section defines at which frame a screen shake should occur.

```ini
# Replace pre-salute with the reference to the animation for which to set this screenshake to
[pre-salute_FrameScreenshake]
# Frame 32 screenshake = true.
32 = 1
```

#### Special quirks

##### Deprecated options

Older char.inis may contain sections or options not mentioned in this guide. Here are a few of them and a brief explanation of each, for posterity:

- `firstmode`: Technically never deprecated - `firstmode` was never used by AO2 in the first place. This is another holdover from AO1, and if you see this in a char.ini you can probably assume it's _very_ old. The purpose of `firstmode` was to work around a limitation in the unofficial Attorney Online 1.8 client which you can read more about [here.](https://sites.google.com/site/attorneyonlinedev/updates/asmallpatchandastoryaboutbuttons)

> **TODO:** It's possible to use static and animated emotes at the same time by including only the `(a)` or the `(b)` animation and putting an identically named static emote in the root folder. Determine if this is intended, and if it is, add a section about it here. - in1tiate

##### DemoThings, and cluttered up miscs

> **TODO:** I wrote this section and then realized it doesn't really fit in a character creation guide. As I'm certain many will find the storied history of AO1 as entertaining as I do, I suggest a dedicated page for documenting it. - in1tiate

A commonality in AO1-era file bases is the presence of a "DemoThings" folder located under `misc/`. This folder's name is somewhat nonsensical - on AO1, its purpose was to store the `char_icon` of every character so that they could be displayed on the character selection screen. AO2 uses the much more sane solution of storing the icon inside the character folder.

Many assets used in the UI were also stored in `misc/` on AO1, some of which have seen continued use to this day - including the ever-popular Missingno placeholder.

### 3. Distributing

Generally, characters are distributed in a bundle. A typical zip file looks like this:

```

base/
    characters/
        MyCharacter1/
        ...
        MyCharacter2/
    ...
    sounds/
    general/
    ...
README.txt

```

This reduces the cognitive load on the player, as all they have to do is drag and drop the contents of the zip file into their AO folder.

I believe that pretty much sums it up. Happy ini-editing!
