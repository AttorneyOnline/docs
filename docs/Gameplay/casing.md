## Casing

Attorney Online, beside being an animated chatroom, hosts a wide variety of roleplaying and casing servers, each with a particular mode of gameplay. Several of these formats are listed below.

### Classic

> **Players**: 5-12<br>
> **Duration**: 4 hours - 2 days (with recesses)

Akin to the original *Ace Attorney* games, classic cases have a defense, prosecution, and witnesses who do what they must to win the judge over to their side. As witnesses are called up to deliver their testimony, the defense spots contradictions, while the prosecution refutes theories and speculation brought up by the defense.

Players must abide to the establishing background and evidence laid forth in a case document. Though some cases are improv (where evidence can be made up on the spot), most are not.

### Investigations

> **Players**: 6-10<br>
> **Duration**: 3-5 hours

Inspired by *Ace Attorney Investigations*, an investigator is pressed to question witnesses and come up with logic to link evidence together, in search for the truth. If the investigator is not able to make progress or is outplayed by a rival, the detective will end the investigation.

### Class Trial

> **Players**: 6-12<br>
> **Duration**: 3-4 hours

In *Danganronpa* class trials, players are provided with character sheets and discuss among each other (using Truth Bullets) who may have committed a crime. Players then vote for who the Blackened really is.
